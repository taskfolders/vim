Just place yourself on top of a short id or UUID and type `<Leader>f`

Since the character `-` is considered part of hash tags and UUIDs, make sure your Vim configuration considers `-` part of a whole word

```
:set iskeyword?                                                                                                   
```

You can set it like this

```
set iskeyword+=- 
```
